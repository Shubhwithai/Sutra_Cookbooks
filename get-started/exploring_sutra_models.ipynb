        "1. **Select the right model for your task**:\n",
        "   - Use SUTRA-V2 for multilingual applications and general conversational AI\n",
        "   - Use SUTRA-R0 for complex reasoning and problem-solving\n",
        "   - Use SUTRA-Q0 (Enterprise) for time-series analysis and forecasting\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Optimize your prompts**:\n",
        "   - Be specific and clear in your instructions\n",
        "   - Provide context when necessary\n",
        "   - Use examples to guide the model's output format\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Adjust temperature settings**:\n",
        "   - Lower temperature (0-0.3) for more deterministic, focused responses\n",
        "   - Higher temperature (0.7-1.0) for more creative, varied responses\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Consider token limits**:\n",
        "   - Be mindful of input and output token limits\n",
        "   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable chunks"
